# Instructions for Removing Commits After a Specific Commit

## Introduction

The following instructions provide a step-by-step guide on how to remove commits that were made after a specific commit in the Git version control system. For example, if we want to remove commits that were made after the commit with the ID `abcd1234`, we will use the `git reset` command.

## Steps

### 1. **Identify the commit to which you want to revert:**

To identify the commit hash you want to revert to, you can use the following command:

```sh
git log
```

This will display the commit history in your repository. Copy the commit hash that you want to revert to.

### 2. **Save working changes:**

If you have uncommitted changes in your repository, save them before performing the reset. You can stash them:

```sh
git stash save "Your changes"
```

### 3. **Perform the reset to the chosen commit:**

Use the `git reset` command with the `--hard` option to reset the current branch to the chosen commit. This will remove all commits that were made after this commit:

```sh
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

For example, if the commit ID is `abcd1234`, the command will be:

```sh
git reset --hard abcd1234
```

### 4. **Force push the changes to the remote repository:**

If you want these changes to be reflected in the remote repository, you need to use the `git push` command with the `--force` (or `-f`) option. **Note:** This will force push your changes and can cause issues for other collaborators, so make sure you are aware and prepared for this.

```sh
git push origin <branch-name> --force
```

For example, if you are working on the `main` branch, the command will be:

```sh
git push origin main --force
```

### 5. **Restore the changes from the stash (if applicable):**

If you saved your changes in the stash in step two, restore them:

```sh
git stash pop
```

## Final Remarks

Performing a git reset with the `--hard` option and force pushing (`--force`) can be destructive actions and should be carried out with caution. Before undertaking such an action, especially for shared remote repositories, ensure that all collaborators are aware of these changes and that you have backups of any essential data.

If you are working on branches other than `main`, adjust the commands accordingly to your needs.
